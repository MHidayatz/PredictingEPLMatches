## Predicting Football Matches

In this project, I will attempt to create a Machine Learning model that is able to predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL).

Project Steps:

* Scrape match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas from [FBRef](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stat).
* Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
* Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn.
* Measure error and improve our predictions.
